For years I have been making endless notes about projects I undertake,
during which I have often noted that my only two redeemable qualities
are literacy and diligence, which seems to get you quite far. I've
finally I've decided to put all these mad ramblings on a blog where
other people can ignore them.

The posts are fairly mundane:

* Computer Science topics; especially if I'm learning them.
* Travel and holidays; especially when I'm planning them.
* Products and their annoyances; especially if I'm buying them.

This blog is made via the [Jekyll][] "static site generator", meaning
that there's no fancy database behind the site, waiting to be
corrupted, (I'm looking at you [WordPress][]). Instead the pages are
processed into a folder which is then served directly to the reader,
thanks to the magic of [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. You can even
fork [this blog][src].

There is plenty of inspiration out there to use a static site
generator, (hello [Yegor][]!), I also really liked the concept of
blogging with [Git, Emacs, and Jekyll][gej]. Some other posts really
helped me with the [archive][], and the other [meta][] pages.

The wonderful icons are from the Open Source [FontAwesome][] via
a [CDN][bootstrapcdn], and the beautiful typefaces are
from [Google Fonts][fonts].

Eventually, this page will be mobile "enhanced" via
the [AMP Project][amp].
