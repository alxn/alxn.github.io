For years I have been making endless notes about projects I
undertake. Finally I've decided to put them online where other people can
ignore them.

The posts are fairly mundane:

* Computer Science topics; especially if I'm learning them.
* Travel and holidays; especially when I'm planning them.
* Products and their annoyances; especially if I'm buying them.

This blog is made via the [Jekyll][] "static site generator", meaning
that there's no fancy database behind the site, waiting to be
corrupted, (I'm looking at you [WordPress][]). Instead the pages are
processed into a folder which is then served directly to the reader,
thanks to the magic of [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. You can even
fork [this blog][src].

The wonderful icons are from the Open Source [FontAwesome][] via
a [CDN][bootstrapcdn], and the beautiful typefaces are
from [Google Fonts][fonts].

Eventually, this page will be mobile "enhanced" via
the [AMP Project][amp].
