Does it fit? Can it scale? How fast? How many? As algorithms are to
coding interviews, this topic is to the design interview.

The book Programming Pearls has some great information about this
topic. It's a skill you should really use up front in designing code,
and systems, hence the need for a separate topic.

You should first take a look
at [Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know][], as well as the
posts by the Google Director of Research ([Norvig][]) on the same
topic. You probably want to vaguely memorise the orders of magnitudes
of those numbers. Remember it's acceptable to round in an interview to
make the math(s) easier.

* While you are there, you should also check out how to [write a spell checker][].

For the networking among us, these posts were nice:

* [Recv Mpps on x86](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-receive-a-million-packets/)
* [10Gbit/s wirespeed](https://netoptimizer.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-calculations-10gbits-wirespeed.html)
* [Unlocked 10Gbps TX](https://netoptimizer.blogspot.com/2014/10/unlocked-10gbps-tx-wirespeed-smallest.html)

So at `10Gbps`, with `64b` packets, you get `67.2ns` *per-packet*,
i.e. `14.8Mpps`, means that you have:

 * 100 MHz == 10 ns => 6 cycles
 * 200 MHz == 5 ns => 13 cycles
 * 1 GHz == 1 ns => 67 cycles
 * 3 GHz == 1/3 ns => 201 cycles

That is not many cycles to do something useful with a packet... and
that's assuming you used something like [DPDK][] to move the data
nicely into the cache for you.

Think about what you are currently working on, and see how it
applies. In the design interview post I'll cover some more examples.
