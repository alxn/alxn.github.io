When applying for jobs, you've probably seen posts that say "read the
company blogs, look at their papers". You're probably thinking: "oh
that's cute, I'll be aware if they ask me some questions about
it". Wrong!  What they'll actually ask you to do, is (re)-design and
scale out those very systems that took them *years* to build.

What's the reason for this madness? Well, think if you were conducting
a senior-level design interview. What would *you* ask about? Perhaps
something you are familiar with... Perhaps something your company has
published papers on...

As I alluded
[previously](/2016/12/03/1-getting-that-tech-job.html#your-situation),
this becomes more important the more senior you get. In someways it
makes sense, they want you to help lead the build and scale out of
products, and this is their way to test that.

## What resources are there?

Compared to studying up on algorithms and coding, there is hardly
anything out there at all. The site [interview bit][] has a few
examples, as does [Gayle's book][ctci], though they are toy examples
compared to the interviews I experienced. If you search really hard
there are a few other blog posts as well.

[ctci]: http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/

This dearth of information got me wondering why Gayle's otherwise
wonderful book is lacking in the design area. There are a couple of
questions, but certainly it's not even one tenth the book, whereas it
will be at least **half** your interview if you are senior.

Suddenly it came to me. According to [LinkedIn][gayle-linkedin], Gayle
left Google before 3 years of post graduate experience. The reason her
book does not cover many design questions, is that she could not have
been at the level where it was expected to give that style of
interview.

While I cannot claim to be an expert in this style of interview,
i.e. I've not been in the 100s of interviews that Gayle has for
algorithms; I've now been through enough to actually understand what I
think they are asking about, and some tips on how to prepare for them.

## So how to prepare for this?

I think the important areas for these design interviews
are [system fundamentals](#system-fundamentals)
and [scale-out architectures](#scale-out-architectures).

While it is unlikely you will be asked to write detailed code for
these topics, you need at least be aware that they exist, if not able
to design most of their algorithms and discuss trade-offs in some
level of detail on a whiteboard.

Regardless of memorising **all** of these, reading them once for
familiarity is probably a good idea. Remember, you will want to adjust
what you are studying based on position.

## Scale Out Architectures

This topic is a little painful for me, the *scale-out* distinction
of [scalability][] didn't really exist when I graduated university,
the focus was purely scale-up:

[scalability]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability

> To scale vertically (or scale up/down) means to add resources to (or
> remove resources from) a single node in a system,

> To scale horizontally (or scale out/in) means to add more nodes to
> (or remove nodes from) a system

The way to prepare is to read the fundamental papers, and understand
how they scale-out. So lets pick a company to study; e.g. *Google*, of
course.

Google has been completely revolutionary as a company for the computer
science industry, by openly publishing papers of their technology, and
allowing others to reproduce it (Hadoop) and build on top of the
concepts (Spark?). Their big overview that you have to read
is [The Data Center As A Computer][], then take a look at their
original papers, and perhaps Yahoo!'s open source versions:

[The Data Center As A Computer]: https://research.google.com/pubs/pub35290.html

* Google: [GFS], [MapReduce], [BigTable], [ChubbyLocks].
* Yahoo: [HDFS], [Hadoop], [HBase], [ZooKeeper][][^1].

## System Fundamentals

Most of these topics should have been covered during an undergraduate
CS degree, so you should only need to revise them.

 * Operating Systems
 * Concurrency, Threading, Locking
 * [Distributed Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing)
   * Eventual Consistency
   * Paxos
 * [Scalable System Design Patterns](https://horicky.blogspot.com/2010/10/scalable-system-design-patterns.html)
 * [CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) ([FAQ](https://github.com/henryr/cap-faq))
 * At Most Once, At Least Once, [Exactly Once.](http://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/)
 * [Consistency model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model)
   * [Eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)
 * [Consistent Hashing](http://www.tom-e-white.com/2007/11/consistent-hashing.html)
 * [Scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing))
   * [Linux CFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler)
   * [WFQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_fair_queueing)

Microsoft Azure has published some very
helpful [infographics][msft-infog], detailing common
cloud [architecture patterns][msft-patterns].

One last fundamental that is worth going over, is
the [8 Fallacies][] of distributed systems.

## Putting it all together

Time to use those [back of the envelope](/2016/12/03/3-envelope.html)
skills...

No really! After understanding how these systems work, it's critical
to apply the [numbers every engineer should know][numbers], so that
you can design and estimate how to deploy a scale-out service. The
service needs to meet your storage, throughput, and latency
requirements; given your CPU, memory, disk, and I/O resources.

[numbers]: https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832

Remember that the shape of the system can be very different given
different resources, while still achieving the desired metrics; though
the goal is always the same, minimise the $$$ cost of the system.

If this all seems unfamiliar, you are not that alone. In a subsequent
post, I'm going to describe a template about how think about and work
through these problems, then as an exercise for myself, I will post
about different scale-out systems with deployment examples.
