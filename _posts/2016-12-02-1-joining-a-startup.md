The number one reason to join a startup is not money. It's certainly
**not** money. So why join then?

For me, there were a couple of reasons:

1. Escape the big company bureaucracy. Certainly, after 10+ years in a
   massive corporation, going to a startup is a freeing experience.

2. Pivot. *PIVOT*. The benefit of a small company, is being able to
   gain new experience out of your comfort zone. Because there are so
   few people, you often get given opportunities that do not exist in
   a large organisation.
   
3. Having a say in the direction of engineering. Creating something
   from scratch. Launching a product from start to finish.

The reality, and this goes for any job change, is that you choose your
current move in order to enable the move *after* this one. I tried to
ensure that I picked a startup opportunity that moved me in the right
direction. Specifically I wanted to have day to day experience in
"big-data" and object oriented programming.

The money aspect, ah, well there's always a possibility of making
money if you IPO or get acquired, I guess. Remember that most startups
fail, so why are **you** special? Don't forget about the pay cut you
will take on going to the startup, which if not in salary, certainly
includes bonus and pension (401k) benefits. So then as you bleed lost
earnings, you should certainly not move thinking it's some "get rich
quick" scheme.

Finding the startup
-------------------

Ideally, the startup is with people you know; more on that in a
minute; but if you've exhausted your circle, then other than the
normal job search sites, there's a couple of possibilities:

1. Make your LinkedIn a perfect profile.
 * Subscribe to premium.
 * Ensure it says you are looking for new opportunities.
 * This will take some time to generate contacts, but there will
   eventually be a deluge.
2. Find recruiters.
 * Reach out to people who've just moved and ask them who theirs were.
3. Trawl the tier-1 VC firms you "like", and look at their job openings.
 * Go find their recruiters on LinkedIn.

Remember that this is going to be a several months process. Always
accept that recruiter on LinkedIn, and always take that call.

Make sure that your Resume/CV *is* up to date, and ready to be sent to
them after you start doing this. You updated it all for the LinkedIn
profile anyway, didn't you...

Picking the startup
-------------------

Having done this now... I would say there's a number of different
factors involved:

Size
====

1. Tiny: Are you a founder? First engineer?
 * This is likely seed/pre-seed. You are in it for the long haul.
 * You'd better like the team, think they are good, and have a few
   ideas about the product.
2. Pre-A. Great options; then cash injection!
 * Every founder will tell you they are just about to close that A
   round. I don't know if it's possible to demand to see the term
   sheet, but it certainly seems like a good idea now. This is a real
   sweet spot if you can achieve it.
3. Post-X. Growth!
 * This is an interesting time. The product is mostly ready or
   working, and has in someway been validated by customer(s). Joining
   now probably means your stock or RSUs are going to be pricey, but
   there's some confidence that this company is going to be somewhat
   successful, though that doesn't equate to a high valuation, or
   being able to liquidate.

I think tiny only makes sense if you are a co-founder, or are really
tight with the team. Pre-A is mystical, it's really "tiny" in
disguise. That leaves post-X, which is hard to pick.

People
======

Are these people you know directly, or confidently indirectly? Do you
trust them; technically or otherwise.

What is the background of the team? Any successful exits? Any
successful products?

What are their motivations for the company?

* I heard one story where a CEO was already a millionaire, so wouldn't
  exit his company until he could become a billionaire. That's not
  going to help you much if you are living in some horrible 1950's
  apartment in the valley.

Are they committed full time to the company? Is **everyone** full
time. You don't want to be the most leveraged person.

Idea
====

What customer problem are they solving?

Make sure that it's a painful problem that needs to be solved with
their solution, it's not just technology looking for a problem. Why
would people want to buy that product *now*.

* Who would you start selling to?
* What is size of market? (How is the product monetized?)
* Who are competitors ? (Did any exit?)
* Why is this better than any competitor?
* Why are the competitors better than this?
* Any barrier to entry for competitors ? (IPR etc).

Note that often "making things cheaper" doesn't help, lots of
companies have fixed "use it or loose it" budgets. They want to do
more with the same.

How hard is it to make the product, given the funding and team?

Professional
============

This should mainly be about what new skills you want to pick up, but
it can also be an opportunity to get into a new job role, e.g. more
customer interaction.

Personal
========

Basic things, but working in a startup can be a slog, so make sure you
can survive:

* Where is the office likely to be.
* Where does everyone else live.
* Is there health insurance.

Company
=======

This is hard to ask about. It's always going to be a rose tinted view,
with no possible problems in the future.

* What is 1 year plan? 2 year plan?
* What is the burn rate currently? How long can it run for?
* Who are the outside board members?
* How are the advisors ?

Note I *really* mean **how** are the advisors; are they engaged with
the company, making house calls. Are they connected enough to get you
in the right meetings?

Remuneration
============

Just go ahead and assume the company will never exit. That said, you
should make sure you get an appropriate amount of equity for your role
for the stage the company is in. Good luck googling that question.

Make sure to ask about early exercise, and the potential cost. You
really, really, want to early exercise, and if you can't afford to do
so, that's really going to hurt later.

If you are in an early startup, and you don't early exercise, that is
a sign you should quit, if the founders don't want to talk about this,
it's also a sign you shouldn't join.

Interviewing
============

If the startup is with people you really know well, there will
probably not be an interview. If it is with people you haven't
directly worked with, then there is a common rule:

* If the interview wasn't tough for you, then the bar is not going to
  be that high for others either. This is a red flag.
