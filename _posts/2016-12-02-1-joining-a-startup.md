The number one reason to join a startup is not money. It's certainly
**not** money. So why join then?

For me, there were a couple of reasons:

1. Escape the big company bureaucracy. Certainly, after 10+ years in a
   massive corporation, going to a startup is a freeing experience.

2. Pivot. *PIVOT*. The benefit of a small company, is being able to
   gain new experience out of your comfort zone. Because there are so
   few people, you often get given opportunities that do not exist in
   a large organisation.
   
3. Having a say in the direction of engineering. Creating something
   from scratch. Launching a product from start to finish.

The reality, and this goes for any job change, is that you choose your
current move in order to enable the move *after* this one. I tried to
ensure that I picked a startup opportunity that moved me in the right
direction. Specifically I wanted to have day to day experience in
"big-data" and object oriented programming.

The money aspect, ah, well there's always a possibility of making
money if you IPO or get acquired, I guess. Remember that most startups
fail, so why are **you** special? Don't forget about the pay cut you
will take on going to the startup, which if not in salary, certainly
includes bonus and pension (401k) benefits. So then as you bleed lost
earnings, you should certainly not move thinking it's some "get rich
quick" scheme.

Finding the startup
-------------------

Ideally, the startup is with people you know; more on that in the next
post; but if you've exhausted your circle, then other than the normal
job search sites, there's a couple of possibilities:

1. Make your LinkedIn a perfect profile.
 * Subscribe to premium.
 * Ensure it says you are looking for new opportunities.
 * This will take some time to generate contacts, but there will
   eventually be a deluge.
2. Find recruiters.
 * Reach out to people who've just moved and ask them who theirs were.
3. Trawl the tier-1 VC firms you "like", and look at their job openings.
 * Go find their recruiters on LinkedIn.

Remember that this is going to be a several months process. Always
accept that recruiter on LinkedIn, and always take that call.

Make sure that your Resume/CV *is* up to date, and ready to be sent to
them after you start doing this. You updated it all for the LinkedIn
profile anyway, didn't you...
