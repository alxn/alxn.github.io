There is **plenty** of information on the internet about getting that
job at *{web-scale firm here}*, this post starts a series about all
the information I amassed whilst preparing. In addition, I have
personal advice about what to expect when interviewing, which is
especially useful if you haven't interviewed for one of these
companies before.

First go buy the wondering "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle
Laakmann McDowell. Read *the book*. Read her answers on quora, read
her [careercup][] site.

I wont repeat what is written in that book, and elsewhere, but I'll
try to add what I discovered. It's kinda huge, so I'll break it into
several follow up posts, this one covers some general notes:

* [Timeline](#timeline)
* [General Advice](#general-advice)
* [Tech Interviews](#tech-interviews)
* [Prep Classes](#prep-classes)
* [Your Situation](#your-situation)
* [Behavioural Questions](#behavioural-questions)

Timeline
--------

First of all, expectations. Lets assume you'll read this post, and the
rest of the series, but wont delve into details.

Just look at the volume of questions in Gayle's book. If it takes you
~15 mins per question, and there are 189 questions, then that's 48
hours of work. If you are only doing 2 hours / week, then that is 24
weeks / **six months** right there. That doesn't even include other
questions!

Do not imagine that you can do this in a short time, this isn't even
just a couple of months work. This is like weight loss, you can't just
go on a crash diet, you need a lifestyle change. It's common for
medical doctors to spend time each year working on their professional
development. Software engineers need to do this too.

Don't start scheduling interviews; even phone screens; before you are
close to being ready.

General Advice
--------------

In addition to *the book*, most companies will email you some advice
on preparing for their interview; read it.

In addition to that, there's professional sites like
[Interview Cake][] that will coach you for a fee.

It can be cheaper, and more effective, to get a friend to help you. If
you are currently not looking for a job, you should consider being
*that* friend, as it's a great way to keep your skills sharp.

Tech Interviews
---------------

There are so many posts out now about how tech interviewing is
completely broken, I think it's like
that [Churchil democracy quote][demo]:

*i.e.*

In fairness, it is just a system that prefers false negatives over
false positives. If you are willing to fire fast, that is also a
possibility for your company, but that seems really brutal for the
candidate, who must have rejected their other offers. I think this
interviewing style really started in the valley after Google posted
its [Lake Wobegon Strategy][] hiring strategy, and a lot of other
companies began to emulate it.

While everyone says:

> We just want to see how you think!

What they really mean is:

> We just want to see how you think, as you get to the exactly right
> answer, as quick as possible.

Do not kid yourself, it's an exam that has *"must show workings for
full credit"* at the top of the paper.

According to some reviews out there, some companies even say "this is
an exam, we know all the past interview questions are out there, and
you are all looking at them".

So you study, and practice with friends at the white board, but what
happens if you get the past exam paper!

Honestly is probably the best course of action here. The interviewer
will get zero signal if you just knock out a perfect answer, and will
view you as dishonest.

Wait a minute though! Sure, you remember that question because you did
it recently, but how well? If you say you know it, and you are tested,
you'd better be certain, because a poor performance here is going to
make you look arrogant or a fool.

Looks like you can't win here, so what to do?

Start working through the question, if it seems really familiar,
mention you did something "similar" last week, but you want to see if
you remember all the pieces correctly. Remember to explain as you go
along (show your working).

Prep Classes
------------

It's so bad out there that companies are even running prep classes.

Facebook runs a 2 hour (on-site/online) class with Gayle that is
really useful. It's probably a good idea to buy her book first and go
over the first few chapters. Of course if you go in person, you can
even score an autograph!

Google does a 1 hour prep class. That's really short, and doesn't
cover half as much that you need to know as the 2 hour FB one, but
they do make you peer-program on the board, so you do get that real
"fear" feeling.

Your Situation
--------------

If you are a recent CS grad, you can really do quite well at these
tech interviews. You've just got to review your entire degree, and you
should be good to go.

For everyone else, in addition to revising your entire degree...

...if you have up to 10 years experience, it's not going to be so bad,
there will be a slightly larger focus on "non-abstract large scale
system design", but it will still be a smaller part of the interview
process.

...if you are more than 10 years into your career, you are going to
get almost 50/50 design questions, or more! There's hardly much
information out there about this interview process, so it's much
harder to prepare for. The site [interviewbit][] does have a couple of
examples, as does Gayle's book, and if you look hard there are a few
other blog posts out there. I'll make a post specifically about how to
prepare for these interviews.

Behavioural Questions
---------------------

This topic is talked about, but I only saw it in just under half the
interviews I did. There's some material out there on questions, and
plenty in Gayle's book.

Even though the topic is smaller, remember to practice with a
friend. You need to be able to listen and remember the question well,
and phrase complicated scenarios clearly.

Don't try too hard to be "funny". Remember that the person doing the
interviewing doesn't know you personally, you need to avoid red flags
here.

Make a note of the stories that come up when you practice, perhaps
even record yourself, so you can see how it comes across.
