I've decided to start blogging some notes, mainly for my own benefit;
as per the quote below; however, if you *really* want to follow along,
there's an RSS, well, [Atom][] feed that you could follow in the
wonderful [Feedly][].

> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.

([source discussion][so-quote])

The topics aren't going to be that exciting to start with:

1. Post-mortem about joining a start-up, and *leaving* a start-up.
2. Notes about "getting that job at {web-scale firm here}", especially
   their process, what they expect, and the interview process.
3. Getting up to speed with new (to me) technology for the new job.
4. Posts about maintain this blog; *meta* I know.
   * Adding in the Open Source [FontAwesome][] via [CDN][bootstrapcdn].
   * [AMPing][amp] up the website on mobile.
